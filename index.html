                <blockquote>"Protagonists are genuine, caring people who talk the talk and walk the walk, and nothing
                    makes them happier than leading the charge, uniting and motivating their team with infectious
                    enthusiasm."</blockquote>
                <ul class="type-description-list">
                    <li>Protagonists take a great deal of pride and joy in guiding others to work together to improve
                        themselves and their community.</li>
                    <li>Protagonists radiate authenticity, concern and altruism, unafraid to stand up and speak when
                        they feel something needs to be said.</li>
                    <li>They find it natural and easy to communicate with others, especially in person, and their
                        Intuitive (N) trait helps people with the Protagonist personality type to reach every mind, be
                        it through facts and logic or raw emotion. </li>

                <blockquote>"Warm and selfless, Protagonists genuinely believe that if they can just bring people
                    together, they can do a world of good."</blockquote>
                <ul class="type-description-list">
                    <li>Tolerant – Protagonists are true team players, and they recognize that that means listening to
                        other peoples’ opinions, even when they contradict their own. They admit they don’t have all
                        the answers, and are often receptive to dissent, so long as it remains constructive.</li>
                    <li>Reliable – The one thing that galls Protagonists the most is the idea of letting down a person
                        or cause they believe in. If it’s possible, Protagonists can always be counted on to see it
                        through.</li>
                    <li>Overly Idealistic – People with the Protagonist personality type can be caught off guard as
                        they find that, through circumstance or nature, or simple misunderstanding, people fight
                        against them and defy the principles they’ve adopted, however well-intentioned they may be.
                        They are more likely to feel pity for this opposition than anger, and can earn a reputation of
                        naïveté.</li>

                <blockquote>"This philosophy of genuine connection is core to the Protagonist personality type, and
                    while it is visible in the workplace and in romance, it is clearest in the breadth and depth of
                    Protagonist friendships."</blockquote>

                    <li>People with the Protagonist personality type take genuine pleasure in getting to know other
                        people, and have no trouble talking with people of all types and modes of thought. </li>
                    <li>Protagonists want to be the best friends possible, and it shows in how they work to find out
                        not just the superficial interests of their friends, but their strengths, passions, hopes and
                        dreams.</li>
                    <li>The joy Protagonists take in moving things forward means that there is always a sense of
                        purpose behind their friendships, creating bonds that are not easily shaken.</li>

                    <li>People with the Protagonist personality type are always up for a good challenge – and nothing
                        thrills them quite like helping others.</li>
                    <li>Protagonists are able to express themselves both creatively and honestly, allowing them to
                        approach positions as sales representatives and advertising consultants from a certain
                        idealistic perspective, intuitively picking up on the needs and wants of their customers, and
                        working to make them happier.</li>

                        diverse roles, at any level of seniority.</li>
                    <li>As colleagues, Protagonists’ desire to assist and cooperate is even more evident as they draw

                        suggestions, working together to develop win-win situations that get the job done. </li>
                    <li>As managers, Protagonists combine their skill in recognizing individual motivations with their
                        natural charisma to not only push their teams and projects forward, but to make their teams
                        want to push forward. </li>
